## Core Architecture

**Block Storage Layer**: 
- Manages fixed-size blocks (4KB by default) for efficient disk space usage
- Supports metadata headers for linking blocks together
- Handles block allocation and reuse of deleted space

**Record Storage Layer**:
- Built on top of Block Storage to handle variable-length records
- Uses linked lists of blocks for large records
- Implements a deletion stack (Record #0) for space reclamation

**Indexing Layer**:
- Primary index on Cow ID (Guid → Record ID)
- Secondary index on Breed + Age composite key
- In-memory implementation (could be replaced with disk-based B-Tree)

**Database Layer**:
- Combines all components into a complete database
- Handles CRUD operations with automatic index maintenance
- Serialization/deserialization of CowModel objects

## Key Features

✅ **Variable-length records** - Handles unknown sizes for Breed, Name, and DnaData
✅ **Space reclamation** - Deleted blocks are reused without requiring vacuum
✅ **Fast lookups** - O(log n) search via indexes
✅ **Minimal overhead** - Direct file access with block-level caching

## Usage Example

The database supports all the required operations:
- `Insert(cow)` - Add new cow with automatic indexing
- `Find(id)` - Fast lookup by Guid
- `FindBy(breed, age)` - Secondary index search
- `Update(cow)` - Modify existing records
- `Delete(cow)` - Remove with space reclamation

This implementation provides the foundation for a high-performance custom database. For production use, you'd want to add:
- Disk-based B-Tree indexes
- Transaction support
- Concurrent access handling
- More sophisticated caching
- Error handling and recovery

The design is modular, so each component can be enhanced independently while maintaining the same interfaces.
